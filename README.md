After you save your Chatgpt apikey and refresh the page, You can use most of the features, except those that depend on Trilium.

Please feel free to reference this page as it directly calls the ChatGPT API.

## Start

1. Create a JS frontend note, then copy the contents from the release file "trilium-chat.js" into the note, or alternatively, import the "trilium-chat.js" file.

2. Set the note with the attribute `#run=frontendStartup `

### Use with DeepSeek
If you want to use your DeepSeek, you need to set the values of `requestUrls.completion` to `https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions`, set `stream` to `true`, and set `model` to `deepseek-chat`.You need to keep all other settings unchanged; Otherwise, the application shortcut key "Alt+Q" will not be able to bring up the dialog window.An example of my settings can be seen below:
```json
{
	"viewWidth": 400,
	"engine": "chatgpt",
	"apiKey": "XXx",
	"requestUrls": {
		"completion": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions"
	},
	"engineOptions": {
		"model": "deepseek-chat",
		"max_tokens": 2500,
		"temperature": 0.3,
		"top_p": 1,
		"presence_penalty": 0.5,
		"frequency_penalty": 0.5,
		"stream": true,
		"n": 1
	},
	"shortcut": {
		"toggle": "Alt+Q",
		"hide": "Esc"
	},
	"faces": [
		"bx-smile",
		"bx-wink-smile",
		"bx-face",
		"bx-happy-alt",
		"bx-cool",
		"bx-laugh",
		"bx-upside-down"
	],
	"colors": [
		"var(--muted-text-color)"
	],
	"autoSave": true,
	"systemPrompt": "",
	"checkUpdates": true
}

### Use with Ollama

If you want to use your own locally hosted [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama), you need to set the values of `requestUrls.completion` to `https://<your-endpoint>/api/chat`, set `stream` to `false`, and set `model` to whichever model you want to use from your Ollama. You should keep the rest of the settings as if they were pointed to ChatGpt. An example of my settings can be seen below:
```json
{
	"viewWidth": 364,
	"engine": "ChatGpt",
	"apiKey": "asdfasdfasdfasdfasdf",
	"requestUrls": {
		"completion": "https://ollama.internal.network/api/chat"
	},
	"engineOptions": {
		"model": "llama3",
		"max_tokens": 2500,
		"temperature": 0.3,
		"top_p": 1,
		"presence_penalty": 0.5,
		"frequency_penalty": 0.5,
		"stream": false,
		"n": 1
	},
	"shortcut": {
		"toggle": "Alt+Q",
		"hide": "Esc"
	},
	"autoSave": true,
	"systemPrompt": "",
	"checkUpdates": true
}
```
#### Allowing Authorization header for use with Ollama
You may also need to modify the Ollama Nginx configuration with the following, to allow it to accept the `Authorization` header (you can see if this is needed by inspecting the traffic from Trilium to your Ollama):
```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;  # Replace with your domain or IP
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:11434;
        proxy_set_header Host localhost:11434;
	add_header Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Authorization";
    }
}
```

#### Allowing CORS for use with Ollama
If you recieve an error regarding CORS, such as the following, you may need to update your Ollama's `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` environment variable, as outlined in this [ollama/ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/669#issuecomment-1783903239) issue. You can set it to something like `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*`.  

```
Request has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
```

### Prompt

The prompt supports customizable options, making it highly flexible to use.

<img src="https://github.com/Lolabird/trilium-chat/assets/89228316/754724ad-799d-42f1-90c4-c51f39258e23" alt="translation options" style="zoom: 33%;" />

The `{{language:English|Chinese|French}}` will be rendered as a dropdown component, allowing you to select the desired option directly when using it.

<img src="./media/image-20230607233913358.png" alt="image-20230607233913358" style="zoom:33%;" />

`{{activeNote}}` supports two types of messages: text and code. For text messages, the content will be rendered in the chat window as it appears in the note, with one exception - if it is an included note, it will be rendered as a link.

It is important to note that because Trilium stores text notes in HTML format, messages sent through `{{activeNote}}` will also be sent in HTML format. This is to provide AI with more information. The prompt can specify how the response should be formatted.

When using `{{activeNote}}`, AI may return HTML, but it will still be rendered as plain text because it is difficult to determine whether the returned HTML is formatting information or actual code. Markdown is easier to handle, and support for markdown rendering may be added in the future.

Prompts will be stored under the `#CHAT_PROMPTS` note. You can manually modify the order or content within it.

### Command

#### thread 

<img src="./media/image-20230607234407989.png" alt="image-20230607234407989" style="zoom:33%;" />

The `favor` command will prioritize the entry in the chat history and display a flag indicating its importance.

The `set` command replaces the current note with the chat content.

The `append` command inserts the current note at the end of the note. 

#### message

<img src="./media/image-20230607234443677.png" alt="image-20230607234443677" style="zoom:33%;" />

The new command, `insert`, allows you to insert the current message at the selected position of the cursor. 

The `set`, `insert`, and `append` commands support both text and code note types. 

### History

<img src="./media/image-20230607235219388.png" alt="image-20230607235219388" style="zoom:33%;" />

The chat history will be stored under the note labeled with the attribute `CHAT_HISTORY_HOME`. If such a note doesn't exist, it will be stored under the default "trilium-chat" note.

When opening the history or prompts, the search bar will be focused by default. You can navigate through the options using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, and select an option by pressing Enter.
